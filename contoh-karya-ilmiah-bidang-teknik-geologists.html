                                            Tornado A tornado is a violent rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tomadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of up to 300 mph. They cạn destroy large buildings, uproot trees, and hurl vehicles hundreds of yards. They can also drive straw anto trees Damage paths can be in exces of one mile wide to 50 miles long. In an average year, 1000 idmadoes are reported nationwide Most tornadoes form from thunderstorms. You neeed warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico und cool, dry air from Canada. When these two air masses meet, they create instability in the athmosphere. A change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height create an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. Rising air within the updraft tilts the rotating airfrom horizontal to vertical. An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area strong rotation1. According to the text, how fast can a tornado ove?A. No more than 200 mphB Upto 250 mph C. Up to 300 mphD.

Beneath the oceans, a global system of mid-ocean ridges produces an estimated 75% of the annual output of magma. An estimated 0,7 cubic miles (3 cubic kilometers ) of lava is erupted. The magma and lava create the edges of new oceanic plates and supply heat and chemicals to some of the Earth's most unusual and rare ecosystems. If an estimate of 4000 volcanoes per million square kilomaters on the floor of the Pacific. Ocean is extrapolated for all the oceans, then there are more than a million submarine (underwater) volcanoes. Perhaps as many as 75000 of these volcanoes rice over half a mile (1 kilometer) above the Cccan floor. Thechnology and hard work by a group of tenacious explorers/geologists have allowed us our first detailed glimpses of submarine volcanoes.3 What is the main idea of the first paragnaph? A.

Ridiculous EarthquakeAn earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor, or tremblor) is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are recorded with a seismometer or a seismograph. The moment magnitude (or the related and mostly obsolete Richter magnitude) of an earthquake is conventionally reported, with magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes being mostly imperceptible and magnitude 7 causing serious damage over large areas. Intensity of shaking is measured on the modified Mercalli scale. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacing the ground When a large carthquake epicenter is located offchore, the scabed sometimes suffers sufficient displacement to cause a tsunami The shaking in carthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally volcanic activity In its most generic sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event-whether a natural phenimenon or an event caused by humans - that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are Caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear experiments. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The term epicenter refers to the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. 5.The severe damage caused by an earthquake usually happens when the magnitude is aboutA 3B. 4 C 6 D. 76.

                                            Krakal beach is about 21 kms from Wonosari, Jogjakarta located some 7 kms from the road that branches off the main road to Baron, crossing limestone hills with their harsh appearance, alternated with terraced rocks which all present a blend of very enchanting scenery.Geologists say that a long time ago, this place was below sea level. In the remaining coral bed, many fossils can still be found. Among all the beaches that stretch along, the coast of Java, Krakal with its white sandy beach surrounded with mountainous rocky hills is the most beautiful one.Meanwhile, the battering of its gigantic waves in a mass of white foam gives more enchantment to this beach. It has enchanted many tourism planning experts from foreign countries. Their interest in exploring Krakal is supported by its attractive potentials such as: sloping and white sandy beach stretching out from dawn until twilight during the whole dry and rainy season.

                                            Professional and Scientific Staff Management (PSSM) is a unique type of temporary staffing agency.  Many organisations today hire highly skilled, technical employees on a short-term, temporary basis, to assist with special projects or to provide a needed technical skill.  PSSM negotiates contracts with its client companies in which it agrees to provide temporary staff in specific job categories for a specified cost.  For example, PSSM has a contract with an oil and gas exploration company in which it agrees to supply geologists with at least a masters degree for $5000 per week.  PSSM has contracts with a wide range of companies, and can place almost any type of professional or scientific staff members, from computer programmers to geologists and astrophysicists. When a PSSM client company determines that it will need a temporary professional or scientific employee, it issues a staffing request against the contract it had previously negotiated with PSSM.  When a staffing request is received by PSSMs contract manager, the contract number referenced on the staffing request is entered into the contract database.  Using information from the database, the contract manager reviews the terms and conditions of the contract and determines whether the staffing request is valid.  The staffing request is valid if the contract has not expired, the type of professional or scientific employee requested is listed on the original contract, and the requested fee falls within the negotiated fee range.  If the staffing request is not valid, the contract manager sends the staffing request back to the client with a letter stating why the staffing request cannot be fulfilled, and a copy of the letter is filed.  If the staffing request is valid, the contract manager enters the staffing request into the staffing request database as an outstanding staffing request.  The staffing request is then sent to the PSSM placement department.In the placement department, the type of staff member, experience, and qualifications requested on the staffing request are checked against the database of available professional and scientific staff.  If a qualified individual is found, he/she is marked reserved in the staff database.  If a qualified individual cannot be found in the database, or is not immediately available, the placement department creates a memo that explains the inability to meet the staffing request, and attaches it to the staffing request.  All staffing requests are then sent to the arrangements department.In the arrangements department the prospective temporary employee is contacted and asked to agree to the placement.  After the placement details have been worked out and agreed to, the staff member is marked placed in the staff database.  A copy of the staffing request and a bill for the placement fee is sent to the client. Finally, the staffing request, the unable to fulfil memo (if any), and a copy of the placement fee bill is sent to the contract manager.  If the staffing request was fulfilled, the contract manager closes the open staffing request in the staffing request database.  If the staffing request could not be filled the client is notified.  The staffing request, placement fee bill, and unable to fulfil memo are then filed in the contract office.draw data flow diagram lv0 &amp; lv1</a>

                                            13. Read the text below to answer the question! A team led by UC Riverside geologists has discovered the first ancestor on the family tree that contains most familiar animals today, including humans. The tiny, wormlike creature, named Ikaria wariootia, is the earliest bilaterian, or organism with a front and back, two symmetrical sides, and openings at either end connected by a gut. The paper is published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For 15 years, scientists agreed that fossilized burrows found in 555 million-year-old Ediacaran Period deposits in Nilpena, South Australia, were made by bilaterians. However, there was no sign of the creature that made the burrows, leaving scientists with nothing but speculation. Then, Scott Evans, a recent doctoral graduate from UC Riverside; and Mary Droser, a professor of geology, noticed miniscule, oval impressions near some of these burrows. With funding from a NASA exobiology grant, they used a three-dimensional laser scanner that revealed the regular, consistent shape of a cylindrical body with a distinct head and tail and faintly grooved musculature. The animal ranged between 2-7 millimeters long and about 1-2.5 millimeters wide, with the largest the size and shape of a grain of rice - just the right size to have made the burrows. "We thought these animals should have existed during this interval, but always understood they would be difficult to recognize," Evans said. "Once we had the 3D scans, we knew that we had made an important discovery." 13.What is the main idea of the passage?

He came from a wealthy family and never had to work. He studied medicine and theology. In 1831 he graduated from University of Cambridge with a degree of theology.He began a career as a scientist quite by chancE. On December 27,1831, 22 years old Charles Darwin joined the crew of the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.The five years expedition collected hydrographic, geologic, and meteorologic data from South America and many other regions around the worlD. Darwin’s own observation on this voyage led to his theory of natural selection.Charles Darwin was greatly influenced by the geologist Adam Sedgwick and naturalist John Henslow in his development of the theory of natural selection, which was to become the foundation concept supporting the theory of evolution. Darwin’s theory holds that environmental effects lead to varying degrees of reproductive success in individuals and groups of organisms. Natural selection tends to promote adaptation in organisms when necessary for survival. This revolutionary theory was published in 1859 in Darwin’s now famous On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection.Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution believed that ….A. people could defend themselves naturallyB. environment affected natural electionC. organism needed adaptation to surviveD. people and nature supported to each otherE. natural selection tend to adapt organism to survive9. How was Darwin’s theory of natural selection developed?A. Adapted by the necessary for survivalB. Influenced by his collection.C. Supported the effect of environment.D. Influenced by John Henslow.E.

                            7. Tornado A tornado is a violent rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tomadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of up to 300 mph. They cạn destroy large buildings, uproot trees, and hurl vehicles hundreds of yards. They can also drive straw anto trees Damage paths can be in exces of one mile wide to 50 miles long. In an average year, 1000 idmadoes are reported nationwide Most tornadoes form from thunderstorms. You neeed warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico und cool, dry air from Canada. When these two air masses meet, they create instability in the athmosphere. A change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height create an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. Rising air within the updraft tilts the rotating airfrom horizontal to vertical. An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area strong rotation1. According to the text, how fast can a tornado ove?A. No more than 200 mphB Upto 250 mph C. Up to 300 mphD.

It is created from violent rotating column of air D. le emrges from underground.Submarine VolcanoesThe most productive volcanic systems on Earth are hidden under an average of 8500 feet (2600 mof water. Beneath the oceans, a global system of mid-ocean ridges produces an estimated 75% of the annual output of magma. An estimated 0,7 cubic miles (3 cubic kilometers ) of lava is erupted. The magma and lava create the edges of new oceanic plates and supply heat and chemicals to some of the Earth's most unusual and rare ecosystems. If an estimate of 4000 volcanoes per million square kilomaters on the floor of the Pacific. Ocean is extrapolated for all the oceans, then there are more than a million submarine (underwater) volcanoes. Perhaps as many as 75000 of these volcanoes rice over half a mile (1 kilometer) above the Cccan floor. Thechnology and hard work by a group of tenacious explorers/geologists have allowed us our first detailed glimpses of submarine volcanoes.3 What is the main idea of the first paragnaph? A.

Ridiculous EarthquakeAn earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor, or tremblor) is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are recorded with a seismometer or a seismograph. The moment magnitude (or the related and mostly obsolete Richter magnitude) of an earthquake is conventionally reported, with magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes being mostly imperceptible and magnitude 7 causing serious damage over large areas. Intensity of shaking is measured on the modified Mercalli scale. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacing the ground When a large carthquake epicenter is located offchore, the scabed sometimes suffers sufficient displacement to cause a tsunami The shaking in carthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally volcanic activity In its most generic sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event-whether a natural phenimenon or an event caused by humans - that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are Caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear experiments. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The term epicenter refers to the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. 5.The severe damage caused by an earthquake usually happens when the magnitude is aboutA 3B. 4 C 6 D. 76.

                            11. Professional and Scientific Staff Management (PSSM) is a unique type of temporary staffing agency.  Many organisations today hire highly skilled, technical employees on a short-term, temporary basis, to assist with special projects or to provide a needed technical skill.  PSSM negotiates contracts with its client companies in which it agrees to provide temporary staff in specific job categories for a specified cost.  For example, PSSM has a contract with an oil and gas exploration company in which it agrees to supply geologists with at least a masters degree for $5000 per week.  PSSM has contracts with a wide range of companies, and can place almost any type of professional or scientific staff members, from computer programmers to geologists and astrophysicists. When a PSSM client company determines that it will need a temporary professional or scientific employee, it issues a staffing request against the contract it had previously negotiated with PSSM.  When a staffing request is received by PSSMs contract manager, the contract number referenced on the staffing request is entered into the contract database.  Using information from the database, the contract manager reviews the terms and conditions of the contract and determines whether the staffing request is valid.  The staffing request is valid if the contract has not expired, the type of professional or scientific employee requested is listed on the original contract, and the requested fee falls within the negotiated fee range.  If the staffing request is not valid, the contract manager sends the staffing request back to the client with a letter stating why the staffing request cannot be fulfilled, and a copy of the letter is filed.  If the staffing request is valid, the contract manager enters the staffing request into the staffing request database as an outstanding staffing request.  The staffing request is then sent to the PSSM placement department.In the placement department, the type of staff member, experience, and qualifications requested on the staffing request are checked against the database of available professional and scientific staff.  If a qualified individual is found, he/she is marked reserved in the staff database.  If a qualified individual cannot be found in the database, or is not immediately available, the placement department creates a memo that explains the inability to meet the staffing request, and attaches it to the staffing request.  All staffing requests are then sent to the arrangements department.In the arrangements department the prospective temporary employee is contacted and asked to agree to the placement.  After the placement details have been worked out and agreed to, the staff member is marked placed in the staff database.  A copy of the staffing request and a bill for the placement fee is sent to the client. Finally, the staffing request, the unable to fulfil memo (if any), and a copy of the placement fee bill is sent to the contract manager.  If the staffing request was fulfilled, the contract manager closes the open staffing request in the staffing request database.  If the staffing request could not be filled the client is notified.  The staffing request, placement fee bill, and unable to fulfil memo are then filed in the contract office.draw data flow diagram lv0 &amp; lv1</h2><br />

                            14. 13. Read the text below to answer the question! A team led by UC Riverside geologists has discovered the first ancestor on the family tree that contains most familiar animals today, including humans. The tiny, wormlike creature, named Ikaria wariootia, is the earliest bilaterian, or organism with a front and back, two symmetrical sides, and openings at either end connected by a gut. The paper is published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For 15 years, scientists agreed that fossilized burrows found in 555 million-year-old Ediacaran Period deposits in Nilpena, South Australia, were made by bilaterians. However, there was no sign of the creature that made the burrows, leaving scientists with nothing but speculation. Then, Scott Evans, a recent doctoral graduate from UC Riverside; and Mary Droser, a professor of geology, noticed miniscule, oval impressions near some of these burrows. With funding from a NASA exobiology grant, they used a three-dimensional laser scanner that revealed the regular, consistent shape of a cylindrical body with a distinct head and tail and faintly grooved musculature. The animal ranged between 2-7 millimeters long and about 1-2.5 millimeters wide, with the largest the size and shape of a grain of rice - just the right size to have made the burrows. "We thought these animals should have existed during this interval, but always understood they would be difficult to recognize," Evans said. "Once we had the 3D scans, we knew that we had made an important discovery." 13.What is the main idea of the passage? A.the descendant on the family tree of familiar animals found in Australia B.a team led by UC Riverside geologists C. Australian geologists finding most animals D. the small ancestor of familiar animals identified in Australia E. the geologists' discovery of a worm in Australia 14.
