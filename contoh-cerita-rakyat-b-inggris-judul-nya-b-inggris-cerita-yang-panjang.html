<strong>SURA AND BAYA</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>
</strong><br />

A long time ago in East Java
there were two strong animals, Sura and Baya. Sura was a shark and Baya was a
crocodile. They lived in a sea. Actually, they were friends. But when they were
hungry, they were very greedy. They did not want to share their food. They
would fight for it and never stop fighting until one of them gave up.<br /><br />
It was a very hot day. Sura and Baya were looking for some food. Suddenly, Baya
saw a goat.<br />
“Yummy, this is my lunch,” said Baya.<br /><br />
“No way! This is my lunch. You are greedy! I had not eaten for two days!” said
Sura.<br />
Then Sura and Baya fought again. After several hours, they were very tired.
Sura had a plan to stop their bad behavior.<br /><br />
“I’m tired of fighting, Baya,” said Sura.<br /><br />
“Me too. What should we do to stop fighting? Do you have any idea?” asked Baya.<br />
“Yes, I do. Let’s share our territory. I live in the water, so I look for food
in the sea. And you live on the land, right? So, you look for the food also on
the land. The border is the beach, so we will never meet again. Do you agree?”
asked Sura.<br /><br />
“Hmm... let me think about it. OK, I agree. From today, I will never go to the
sea again. My place is on the land,” said Baya.<br /><br />
Then they both lived in the different places. But one day, Sura went to the
land and looked for some food in the river. He was very hungry and there was
not much food in the sea. Baya was very angry when he knew that Sura broke the
promise.<br /><br />
“Hey, what are you doing here? This is my place. Your place is in the sea!”<br /><br />
“But, there is water in the river, right? So, this is also my place!” said
Sura.<br /><br />
Then Sura and Baya fought again. They both hit each other. Sura bit Baya's
tail. Baya did the same thing to Sura. He bit very hard until Sura finally gave
up. He went back to the sea. Baya was very happy. He had his place again.<br /><br />
The place where they were fighting was a mess. Blood was everywhere. People
then always talked about the fight between Sura and Baya. They then named the
place of the fight as Surabaya, it’s from Sura the shark and Baya the
crocodile. People also put their fight as the symbol of Surabaya city.

                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Malin Kundang</p><p>Once upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”</p><p></p><p>In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.</p><p></p><p>It had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet. Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.</p><p></p><p>After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.</p><p>            <strong>Sangkuriang.</strong>                       Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.</p><p></p><p>They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p></p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.</p><p></p><p>After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.</p><p></p><p>Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.</p><p></p><p>Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).</p><br />

                        Cerita Rakyat Jawa Timur Cindelaras (Bahasa Inggris)<br />Raden Putra was the king of Jenggala kingdom. He had a beautiful queen and concubine. Unlike the queen, the concubine had bad personalities. She was envious and jealous with the queen, so she planned to make the queen leave the palace. The concubine then asked the royal healer to help her in her plan. One day, the concubine pretended to be ill. Raden Putra called the royal healer to give the concubine treatments. “What is her disease?” Raden Putra asked the royal healer. “I’m very sorry, My Majesty. She is sick because the queen put poison in her meal,” the royal healer lied. <br />Raden Putra was shock and angry to hear the explanation. He called the queen and asked her if the story was true. Of course the queen denied, but Raden Putra won’t listen. “Please Your Majesty, have mercy. I really didn’t do anything,” cried the queen in her tears. Raden Putra’s anger ended in a decision. The queen should be banished to the woods and terminated. He did not know that the queen was already pregnant. Raden Putra commanded one of his general to do the punishment. The queen was banished to the woods, but the wise general didn’t have the heart to kill her. He built a simple house in the woods for her. On his way back to the palace, he smeared his sword with rabbit blood, so Raden Putra would believe that he had killed the queen. <br />After the general left, the queen lived by herself in the woods. Several months later, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. The baby was named Cindelaras. He grew up as a nice, healthy, and handsome boy. One day, while Cindelaras helped her mother to collect some fire woods, an eagle dropped an egg. Cindelaras brought the egg to be brooded by a chicken behind their house. The egg hatched into a chick and then it slowly became a strong rooster. The rooster is no ordinary rooster. The rooster could sing. Every morning, the rooster woke Cindelaras up with its beautiful song, “My master is Cindelaras. His house is in the woods. He’s the son of Raden Putra.” The rooster often sang that song. <br />Cindelaras always woke up early in the morning and listen happily to his rooster’s song. He didn’t realize the meaning of the song until one day, he started to think. “Who is Raden Putra?” he asked his mother. The queen then told him the whole story. She also told him why they were banned from the kingdom and lived in the woods. Cindelaras was very surprised. He decided to go to the palace to meet the king, his father. Cindelaras asked her mother’s permission to go to the kingdom and to tell the king what really happened. He also brought his rooster that grew bigger and stronger each day.On his way, Cindelaras stopped at a village. There, he met some people who were involved in cockfighting. They challenge him to see how strong his rooster was. “If your rooster wins, you’ll get a reward,” said the man who challenged him. Cindelaras accepted the challenge. In a few minutes, his rooster defeated the opponent’s rooster. He was challenged again by other man, and one more time, his rooster won. He won again and again.The news about Cindelaras’ rooster quickly spread to the whole Jenggala kingdom and made Raden Putra curious. So, he invited Cindelaras to the palace. “What is your name, boy?” Raden Putra asked as Cindelaras arrived in the palace. “My name is Cindelaras, Your Majesty,” Cindelaras answered. He felt both thrilled and happy to see Raden Putra. <br />Raden Putra challenged Cindelaras with one condition. If Raden Putra’s rooster won, Cindelaras’ head would be cut off. But if Cindelaras’ rooster won, Raden Putra would share half of his wealth. Cindelaras accepted the condition. The competition was held in the front yard of the palace. The two roosters fought bravely. But in just a few minutes, Cindelaras’ rooster won the fight! Raden Putra shook his head and stared at Cindelaras from his seat, “That rooster is no ordinary rooster, and the boy is not an ordinaty boy either. Who is he exactly?” he thought. Raden Putra was about to asked when suddenly Cindelaras’ rooster sang the song, “My master is Cindelaras. His house is in the woods. He’s the son of Raden Putra.”  Raden Putra was surprised. “Is it true?” he asked. “Yes, My Majesty. My name is Cindelaras and my mother was the queen,” said Cindelaras. Raden putra called the general who had banished the queen. The general then confessed that he never killed the queen. Later, the royal healer also admitted his mistake. Raden Putra was so shocked. He immediately went to the woods to pick up the queen. Ever since, Cindelaras and his parents lived happily together. As for the concubine, she was sent to the jail as punishment<br /><br /><br />semoga dpt membantu<br />

                        Cerita rakyat from West SumatraOnce upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.It had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet. Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.The Lonely Landy
<br />
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.

<br />Terjemahan

<br />Suatu hari, ada seorang bernama landak Landy. Dia kesepian. Tidak ada 
yang ingin bermain dengannya, karena mereka takut lonjakan nya.

<br />

"Ya Landy. Kami tidak ingin bermain dengan Anda karena Anda terlalu paku
 tajam. Kami tidak ingin Anda menyakiti kita, "kata Cici kelinci satu 
hari.

<br />

"Cici benar, Landy. Ini bukan karena Anda buruk atau kasar kepada kami, 
tidak, Landy. Hanya karena paku Anda. Mereka akan menusuk kita jika kita
 dekat dengan Anda, "kata Tito ayam.

<br />

Landy merasa kesepian. Landy menghabiskan sebagian besar hari waktu 
bermimpi di tepi sungai, "Saya akan senang jika tidak ada paku di tubuh 
saya."

<br />

Tiba-tiba, Kuku kura-kura muncul dari sungai. Dia datang ke Landy dan berkata, "Landy, apa yang Anda pikirkan?"

<br />

"Oh, tidak," jawab Landy.

<br />

"Jangan berbohong padaku, Landy! Siapa tahu aku bisa membantumu, "kata 
Kuku bijak. Kemudian dia duduk di samping Landy. Dia tidak takut 
lonjakan Landy.

<br />

Tak lama, Landy mengatakan masalahnya. Kuku mengangguk kepalanya. Dia 
berkata, "Kasihan kamu. Tapi itu bukan salahmu. Aku tahu, paku Anda 
sangat berguna dan membantu bagi Anda. Mereka akan menyadari suatu hari 
nanti. Percayalah! "

<br />

"Terima kasih, Kuku. Anda adalah teman terbaik saya. "

<br />

Suatu hari, Koko katak mengadakan pesta ulang tahunnya. Dia mengundang 
semua teman-temannya, termasuk Landy. Tapi dia memutuskan untuk tidak 
datang. Dia tidak ingin mengacaukan pesta.

<br />

"Aku akan datang dengan Anda Landy. Aku akan memberitahu semua orang 
bahwa Anda tidak berbahaya, "kata Kuku. Akhirnya Landy menghadiri pesta.
 Semua orang menikmatinya.

<br />

Tiba-tiba Tito berteriak, "Bantuan .... membantu ....! Kejahatan 
serigala datang. Menyelamatkan diri! "Lalu, semua orang menyelamatkan 
hidup mereka, kecuali Kuku dan landy. Kuku menarik kepalanya dan kakinya
 ke dalam cangkangnya. Dan Landy digulung tubuhnya menjadi bola.

<br />

Secara tidak sengaja, serigala jahat menyentuh Landy. Tentu saja, 
lonjakan ditusuk dia. Dia berteriak, "Aduh!" Karena kakinya berdarah, 
dia tidak mengejar teman Landy lagi. Kemudian, dia lari.

<br />

"Horray .... Horray ....! Hidup Landy! Dia menyelamatkan hidup kita, 
"kata Cici dan teman-temannya. Mereka mengucapkan terima kasih dari saat
 itu. Landy tidak kesepian lagi.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Sangkuriang is a legend originating from West Java. The legend revolves around the creation of the lake Bandung, Mount Tangkuban Parahu, Mount Burangrang, and Mount Bukit Tunggul.</p><p></p><p>From this legend, we can determine how long the Sundanese have lived in the highlands of Bandung. From the legend which is supported by geological facts, it is estimated that Sundanese people have lived on this plain since thousands of years before Christ.</p><p></p><p>The legend of Sangkuriang was originally an oral tradition. Written references to this legend are in the Bujangga Manik manuscript written on palm leaves dating from the late 15th or early 16th century AD.

The family consists of father, mother, and a beautiful girl named Garlic. They are a harmonious and happy family despite his father worked as an ordinary merchant. One day, the happiness in this family was lost because the mother died. Garlic was very sad because she was very fond of her mother. Her father was also so sad because he loved his wife so much.<br /><br />After Garlic’s mother died, her house was visited frequently by a widow who had a daughter named Onion. The widow often came with Onion to the Garlic’s home by bringing food, helping to clean the house, and chatting with Garlic’s father. Finally, the father thinks that he should marry the widow and made the widow as a new mother for Garlic.<br /><br />He asked for consideration of the proposal to Garlic. After being allowed to get married by Garlic, then her father immediately carried out the marriage. They become a new family and lived in a house. At first, the mother and Onions behaved Garlic very well. However, the good behavior did not to be last long. Soon, the Onion and her mother began to show their bad attitude. Garlic was often scolded and given heavy works when the father went to trade. She had to do a lot of housework while the Onions just sit and did not work at all. However, the situation was never told by her to his father, so the Garlic continued to be treated badly by Onions and her mother.<br /><br />One day, his father was sick and passed away. Since then, Garlic was treated worse than before. Garlic almost never had a break every day. In the morning, she had to get up in order to prepare breakfast and the water for Onion and her mother. Later, she also gave eating to the livestock, washing clothes, and even watering the entire garden. Although she should do so many works, she always did it happily. She hoped, with such sincerity, her mother would love her sincerely someday.<br /><br />On the morning, Garlic went to the river to wash the clothes. She was so excited and washed vigorously. Because of getting too excited, she was not aware that there was a shirt that washed away. She realized that the shirt had been washed away when the flow carried it far enough. Later, she pursued but did not get the shirt. She felt hopeless and immediately went home.<br /><br />The shirt was her mother’s favorite. Of course, the mother was angry and told her to look for the shirt until she could found it. Garlic came back to the river and walked to the west to seek her mother’s favorite shirt. She walked along the river up to tens of kilometers. After that, Garlic suddenly saw someone who was bathing the buffalo in the river. She asked the man about the clothes were washed away. Later, she was informed that the shirt drifting and it was not far from where she was standing. At that moment, Garlic immediately ran down the river to find the shirt.<br /><br />It was getting dark and the Garlic found a home. Because of completely exhausted, she decided to take a break in the house. Apparently, it housed an old lady who had previously found the shirt. The old lady wanted to return the shirt to her, but she should accompany the old lady during a week. She agreed to stay with the lady for a week. Within a week, she made the old lady to be so happy because she was diligent and never complained even though felt so tired.<br /><br />After accompanying for a week, she was given a pumpkin as the gift. When opening it, she was very surprised because there were so much gold and gems. She immediately went home and told the happening to her mother and also Onion. However, the gold and jewels that she got immediately seized and she was forced to tell where the jewelry could be obtained. Garlic immediately said that she got it from an old lady who lived near the river.<br /><br />In the next day, Onion came to that house and stayed for a week like what Garlic did. However, because Onion was a lazy girl, the old lady gave a different pumpkin from Garlic. Onion did not care and Onion immediately went home to open the pumpkin with her mother. Apparently, the content was not gems or gold, but the venomous snake that bit of Onion and the mother. Both of them died because of their greed.<br /><br />After the happening, Garlic was living alone, but she was more calm and lived happily with its gold and gem<br /><br />

                        Arina<br />Jln. Mawar, 24<br />Bandar Lampung 1453<br /><br />Hi my companion, how are you there? I have a ton of stories in my new city. Clearly, this city is exceptionally wonderful and I think I would stay here in a drawn out stretch of time. A week ago, I visit to numerous extraordinary places, for example, shoreline, waterfall, and hot showering spot.<br /><br />My family and I went in the morning to visit the shoreline and we went for surfing. As I would like to think, that was the best surfing place ever. In the event that you are traveling to my city, you will locate the huge waves and you'll adore it. At that point, I went to the waterfall. I felt how the waterfall falling into my body and it was extremely energizing. Shouldn't something be said about the hot washing spot? I would prefer not to let you know now, on the grounds that I need you to visit here so we can appreciate those spots together. It is a decent city, particularly for the traveler destinations.<br /><br />Ideally we can meet soon, my closest companion.<br /><br />Best Regard,<br /><br /><br />Andika<br />

He ran two times longer than the distance Joko was covered. Then, he decided to return back to home. He ran as fast as he could but the Sun had already turned orange. Unfortunately, he could not return to home on time. The sun had already set in his half way to home.<br /><br />Joni was defeated because of his greediness!<br /><br />Moral Value : GREEDINESS WILL MAKE YOU LOSE EVERYTHING<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The Ant and the Dove
</p><p>
</p><p>One hot day, an ant was seeking for some water. After walking around for a moment, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell unintentionally into the water.
</p><p>
</p><p>She could have sunk if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly put off a leaf from a tree and dropped it immediately into the water near the struggling ant. Then the ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.
</p><p>
</p><p>Not long after at that, there was a hunter nearby who was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it in this way.
</p><p>
</p><p>Guessing what he should do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net and the dove flew away quickly from this net.
</p><p>
</p><p>The morality: One good turn deserves another.

</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Semut dan Merpati
</p><p>
</p><p>Suatu hari yang panas, seekor semut sedang mencari air. Setelah beberapa saat berkeliling, dia sampai ke sebuah mata air. Untuk mencapai mata air itu, dia harus memanjat rumput terlebih dahulu. Saat dia memanjat ke atas, dia terpeleset dan secara tidak sengaja jatuh ke dalam air.
</p><p>
</p><p>Dia mungkin bisa saja tenggelam jika burung merpati yang sedang di atas pohon di dekatnya itu tidak melihatnya. Karena melihat si semut sedang dalam kesulitan, burung merpati pun cepat memetik daun dari pohon dan langsung menjatuhkannya ke dalam air dekat si semut yang mencoba menyelamatkan diri itu. Kemudian si semut pun bergerak menuju daun dan kemudian naik ke atasnya. Daun itu membawanya ke darat dengan selamat.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tidak lama kemudian, ada seorang pemburu yang membuang jaring ke arah burung merpati, berharap dengan cara ini bisa menjebak si burung merpati.
</p><p>
</p><p>Berpikir sejenak tentang apa yang harus dia lakukan, kemudian semut cepat menggigit tumit orang tersebut. Karena merasa sakit, si pemburu akhirnya menjatuhkan jaringnya dan kemudian burung merpati terbang keluar dari jaring tersebut dengan cepat.

Timmy was a small and timid rabbit, who was often bullied by the bigger and stronger animals in the forest. Despite this, he was determined to prove to everyone that he was just as brave as any other animal.</p><p>One day, Timmy heard that the forest was in danger. A giant dragon had moved into the nearby mountains and was destroying everything in its path. The other animals were too scared to do anything about it, but Timmy knew he had to do something. So, he set off on a journey to the mountains to confront the dragon.</p><p>As he journeyed, he met many animals who tried to discourage him. They told him that he was too small and weak to fight the dragon, but Timmy didn't listen. He knew that he had courage in his heart, and that was all he needed.</p><p>Finally, he reached the dragon's lair. The dragon was huge and fierce, but Timmy didn't back down. He stood tall and bravely faced the dragon. To Timmy's surprise, the dragon didn't attack. Instead, it told Timmy that it was not a fierce dragon at all, but a kind dragon who was only trying to protect its eggs from thieves.</p><p>Timmy was overjoyed to have made a new friend and the dragon was glad to have someone understand it's situation. The dragon asked Timmy to help protect it's eggs, and Timmy agreed. He used his quick thinking and small size to outsmart the thieves who were trying to steal the dragon's eggs.</p><p>Thanks to Timmy's bravery, the forest was saved, and the dragon and its eggs were protected. From that day on, Timmy was no longer seen as a small and timid rabbit. He was a hero, and all the animals in the forest looked up to him with respect and admiration. Timmy had proven that even the smallest and weakest of us can do great things when we have courage in our hearts.</p><p>The End.</p><br />
